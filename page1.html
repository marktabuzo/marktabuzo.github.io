            One of my most favorite of all times is Tony Stark a.k.a. <b> Iron Man </b> <br>
            I am really amazed by his suits and the technology itself that he uses <br>
            I also think that he is a great person not just in movies but also in real life <br>

            Godzilla is also one of my favorites because of how strong and powewrful he is <br>
            Many people might think that Godzilla is not that strong but I believe that Godzilla is the Alpha <br>
            Unlike others I've seen through Godzilla's suffering that's why I idolize him <br>    
            Despite of being strong and powerful he had suffered enough. <br>
